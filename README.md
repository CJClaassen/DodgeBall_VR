# DodgeBall_VR
A VR game I made for one of my Honor's degree modules.

Title: Dodge ball

The user will be in a small room, measured to be the same size as the available space in the office. There will be small cannons that move along the walls of the room. The cannons will shoot out balls which the user will have to dodge. There will be two types of balls, red and blue balls. When the red balls are shot out, the user will have to dodge the balls and if the user gets hit the user will lose health, If the user loses all their health, they lose the game. The user can catch the blue balls and throw them back at the cannons. Each cannon will have a target above it. If the target is hit with a blue ball the cannon is destroyed. The user wins the level by destroying each cannon. As the levels goes on, they become more difficult with more cannons and the cannons will move faster.
The menu of the game will take also be interactive. It will be in the same room, as the rest of the game, but there will be big floating boards with targets next to them. Each board will be an option in the menu to select. (There will be no cannons firing at you in the menu)
The user will have an endless supply of blue balls with which he/she needs to hit the target to select the corresponding menu option. This helps the user practice their throwing before they even get into the game.
